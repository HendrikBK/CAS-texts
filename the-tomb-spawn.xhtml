In a wine-shop near the northern gate, many travelling merchants from outer lands, parched and weary, were refreshing themselves with the famed vintages of Yoros. To divert them from their fatigue, a storyteller spoke amid the clinking of the wine-cups: 
</p><p class="calibre7">"Great was Ossaru, being both king 
and wizard. He ruled over half the continent of Zothique. His armies were like the rolling sands, blown by the simoom. He commanded the genii of storm and of darkness, he called down the spirits of the sun. Men knew his wizardry as the green cedars know the blasting of levin. 
</p><p class="calibre7">"Half immortal, he lived from age to age, waxing in his wisdom and power till the end. Thasaidon, black god of evil, prospered his every spell and enterprise. And during his latter years he was companioned by the monster Nioth Korghai, who came down to Earth from an alien world, riding a fire-maned comet. 
</p><p class="calibre7">"Ossaru, by his skill in astrology, had foreseen the coming of Nioth Korghai. Alone, he went forth into the desert to await the monster. In many lands people saw the falling of the comet, like a sun that came down by night upon the waste; but only King Ossaru beheld the arrival of Nioth Korghai. He returned in the black, moonless hours before dawn, when all men slept, bringing the strange monster to his palace, and housing him in a vault beneath the throne-room, which he had prepared for Nioth Korghai’s abode. 
</p><p class="calibre7">"Dwelling always thereafter in the 
vault, the monster remained unknown and unbeheld. It was said that he gave advice to Ossaru, and instructed him in the lore of the outer planets. At certain periods of the stars, women and young warriors were sent down as a sacrifice to Nioth Korghai; and these never returned to give account of that which they had 
seen. None could surmise his aspect; but all who entered the palace heard ever in the vault beneath a muffled noise as of slow-beaten drums, and a regurgitation such as would be made by an underground fountain; and sometimes men heard an evil cackling as of a mad cockatrice. 
</p><p class="calibre7">"For many years King Ossaru was served by Nioth Korghai, and gave service to the monster in return. Then Nioth Korghai sickened with a strange malady, and men heard no more the cackling in the sunken vault; and the noises of drums and fountain-mouths grew fainter, and ceased. The spells of the wizard king were powerless to avert his death; but when the monster had died, Ossaru surrounded his body with a double zone of enchantment, circle by circle, and closed the vault. And later, when Ossaru died, the vault was opened from above, and the king’s mummy was lowered therein by his slaves, to repose for ever beside that which remained of Nioth Korghai. 
</p><p class="calibre7">"Cycles have gone by since then; and Ossaru is but a name on the lips of storytellers. Lost now is the palace wherein he dwelt, and the city thereabout, some  <span><span id="calibre_link-12" data-page-number="635" data-page-name="Page:Weird Tales Volume 23 Issue 5 (1934 05).djvu/109" data-page-index="109" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Weird_Tales_Volume_23_Issue_5_(1934_05).djvu/109"></span></span>saying that it stood in Yoros, and some, in the empire of Cincor, where Yethlyreom was later built by the Nimboth dynasty. And this alone is certain, that somewhere still, in the sealed tomb, the alien monster
abides in death, together with King Ossaru. And about them still is the inner circle of Ossaru's enchantment, rendering their bodies incorruptible throughout all the decay of cities and kingdoms; and
around this is another circle, guarding against all intrusion: since he who enters there by tlie tomb's door will die instantly and will putrefy in the moment of death, falling to dusty corruption ere he strike the ground.
</p><p class="calibre7">"Such is the legend of Ossaru and Nioth Korghai. No man has ever found
their tomb; but the wi2ard Namirrha, prophesying darkly, foretold many ages ago that certain travellers, passing through the desert, would some day come upon it unaware. And he said that these travellers, descending into the tomb by another way than the door, would behold a strange
prodigy. And he spoke not concerning the nature of the prodigy, but said only that Nioth Korghai, being a creature from some far world, was obedient to alien laws in death as in life. And of that which Namirrha meant, no man has yet guessed the secret."
</p><p class="calibre7">The brothers Milab and Marabac, who were jewel-merchants from Ustaim, had
listened raptly to the story-teller.
</p><p class="calibre7">"Now truly this is a strange tale," said Milab. "However, as all men know, there were great wizards in the olden days, workers of deep enchantment and wonder; and also there were true prophets.
And the sands of Zothique are full of lost tombs and cities."
</p><p class="calibre7">"It is a good story," said Marabac, "but it lacks an ending. Prithee, O teller of tales, canst tell us no more than this? Was there no treasure of precious metals and jewels entombed with the monster and the king? I have seen sepulchers where the dead were walled with gold ingots, and sarcophagi that poured forth rubies like the gouted blood of vampires."
</p><p class="calibre7">"I relate the legend as my fathers told it," affirmed the story-teller. "They who are destined to find the tomb must tell the rest&mdash;if haply they return from the finding."
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">M</span></span></span><span class="smallcaps">ilab</span> and Marabac had traded their store of uncut jewels, of carven talismans
and small jasper and carnelian idols, making a good profit in Faraad. Now, laden with rosy and purple-black pearls from the southern gulfs, and the black sapphires and winy garnets of Yoros, they were returning northward toward Tasuun with a company of other merchants on the long, circuitous journey to Ustaim by the orient sea.
</p><p class="calibre7">The way had led through a dying land. Now, as the caravan approached the borders of Yoros, the desert began to assume a profounder desolation. The hills were dark and lean, like recumbent mummies of giants. Dry waterways ran down to lake-bottoms leprous with salt. Billows of gray sand were driven high on the crumbling cliffs, where gentle waters had once rippled. Columns of dust arose and went by like fugitive phantoms. Over
all, the sun was a monstrous ember in a charred heaven.
</p><p class="calibre7">Into this waste, which was seemingly unpeopled and void of life, the caravan went warily. Urging their camels to a swift trot in the narrow, deep-walled ravines, the merchants made ready their spears and claymores and scanned the barren ridges with anxious eyes. For here, in hidden caves, there lurked a wild and half-bestial people, known as the Ghorii.
Akin to the ghouls and jackals, they were eaters of carrion; and also they were  <span><span id="calibre_link-13" data-page-number="636" data-page-name="Page:Weird Tales Volume 23 Issue 5 (1934 05).djvu/110" data-page-index="110" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Weird_Tales_Volume_23_Issue_5_(1934_05).djvu/110"></span></span>anthropophagi, subsisting by preference on
the bodies of travellers, and drinking their
blood in lieu of water or wine. They were
dreaded by all who had occasion to journey
between Yoros and Tasuun.
</p><p class="calibre7">The sun climbed to its meridian, searching
with ruthless beams the nethermost
umbrage of the strait, steep defiles. The
fine ash-light sand was no longer stirred
by any puff of wind.
</p><p class="calibre7">Now the road ran downward, following
the course of some olden stream between
acclivitous banks. Here, in lieu of
former pools, there were pits of sand
dammed up by riffles or boulders, in
which the camels floundered knee-deep.
And here, without the least warning, in a
turn of the sinuous bed, the gully swarmed
and seethed with the hideous earth-brown
bodies of the Ghorii, who appeared instantaneously
on all sides, leaping wolfishly
from the rocky slopes or flinging
themselves like panthers from the high
ledges.
</p><p class="calibre7">These ghoulish apparitions were unspeakably
ferocious and agile. Uttering
no sound, other than a sort of hoarse
coughing and spitting, and armed only
with their double rows of pointed teeth
and their sickle-like talons, they poured
over the caravan in a climbing wave. It
seemed that there were scores of them to
each man and camel. Several of the
dromedaries were thrown to earth at once,
with the Ghorii gnawing their legs and
haunches and chines, or hanging dogwise
at their throats. They and their
drivers were buried from sight by the
ravenous monsters, who began to devour
them immediately. Boxes of jewels and
bales of rich fabrics were tom open in
the melee, jasper and onyx idols were
strewn ignominiously in the dust, pearls
and rubies, unheeded, lay weltering in
puddled blood; for these things were of
no value to the Ghorii.
</p><p class="calibre7">Milab and Marabac, as it happened,
were riding at the rear. They had lagged
behind, somewhat against their will, since
the camel ridden by Milab had gone lame
from a stone-bruise; and thus, by good
fortune, they evaded the ghoulish onset.
Pausing aghast, they beheld the fate of
their companions, whose resistance was
overcome with horrible quickness. The
Ghorii, however, did not perceive Milab
and Marabac, being wholly intent on devouring
the camels and merchants they
had dragged down, as well as those members
of their own band that were wounded
by the swords and lances of the travellers.
</p><p class="calibre7">The two brothers, levelling their spears,
would have ridden forward to perish
bravely and uselessly with their fellows.
But, terrified by the hideous tumult, by
the odor of blood and the hyena-like scent
of the Ghorii, their dromedaries balked
and bolted, carrying them back along the
route into Yoros.
</p><p class="calibre7">During this unpremeditated flight they
soon saw another band of the Ghorii, who
had appeared far off on the southern
slopes and were running to intercept them.
To avoid this new peril Milab and Marabac
turned their camels into a side ravine.
Travelling slowly because of the lameness
of Milab's dromedary, and thinking
to find the swift Ghorii on their heels at
any moment, they went eastward for
many miles with the sun lowering behind
them, and came at midafternoon to the
low and rainless watershed of that immemorial
region.
</p><p class="calibre7">Here they looked out over a sunken
plain, wrinkled and eroded, where the
white walls and domes of some innominate
city gleamed. It appeared to Milab
and Marabac that the city was only a few
leagues away. Deeming they had sighted
some hidden town of the outer sands,
and hopeful now of escaping their  <span><span id="calibre_link-14" data-page-number="637" data-page-name="Page:Weird Tales Volume 23 Issue 5 (1934 05).djvu/111" data-page-index="111" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Weird_Tales_Volume_23_Issue_5_(1934_05).djvu/111"></span></span>pursuers, they began the descent of the long
slope toward the plain.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">F</span></span></span><span class="smallcaps">or</span> two days, on a powdery terrain
that was like the bituminous dust of
mummies, they travelled toward the ever-receding
domes that had seemed so near.
Their plight became desperate; for between
them they possessed only a handful
of dried apricots and a water-bag that was
three-fourths empty. Their provisions,
together with their stock of jewels and
carvings, had been lost with the pack-dromedaries
of the caravan. Apparently
there was no pursuit from the Ghorii;
but about them there gathered the red
demons of thirst, the black demons of
hunger. On the second morning Milab's
camel refused to rise and would not respond
either to the cursing of its master
or the prodding of his spear. Thereafter,
the two shared the remaining camel, riding
together or by turns.
</p><p class="calibre7">Often they lost sight of the gleaming
city, which appeared and disappeared like
a mirage. But an hour before sunset, on
the second day, they followed the far-thrown
shadows of broken obelisks and
crumbling watch-towers into the olden
streets.
</p><p class="calibre7">The place had once been a metropolis;
but now many of its lordly mansions
were scattered shards or heaps of downfallen
blocks. Great dunes of sand had
poured in through proud triumphal arches,
had filled the pavements and courtyards.
Lurching with exhaustion, and
sick at heart with the failure of their
hope, Milab and Marabac went on, searching
everywhere for some well or cistern
that the long desert years had haply
spared.
</p><p class="calibre7">In the city's heart, where the walls of
temples and lofty buildings of state still
served as a barrier to the engulfing sand,
they found the ruins of an old aqueduct,
leading to cisterns dry as furnaces. There
were dust-choked fountains in the market-places
but nowhere was there anything
to betoken the presence of water.
</p><p class="calibre7">Wandering hopelessly on, they came
to the ruins of a huge edifice which, it
appeared, had been the palace of some
forgotten monarch. The mighty walls,
defying the erosion of ages, were still
extant. The portals, guarded on either
hand by green brazen images of mythic
heroes, still frowned with unbroken
arches. Mounting the marble steps, the
jewelers entered a vast, roofless hall where
Cyclopean columns towered as if to bear
up the desert sky.
</p><p class="calibre7">The broad pavement flags were mounded
with debris of arches and architraves
and pilasters. At the hall's far extreme
there was a dais of black-veined marble
on which, presumably, a royal throne had
once reared. Nearing the dais, Milab and
Marabac both heard a low and indistinct
gurgling as of some hidden stream or
fountain, that appeared to rise from underground
depths below the palace pavement.
</p><p class="calibre7">Eagerly trying to locate the source of
the sound, they climbed the dais. Here
a huge block had fallen from the wall
above, perhaps recently, and the marble
had cracked beneath its weight, and a
portion of the dais had broken through
into some underlying vault, leaving a dark
and jagged aperture. It was from this
opening that the water-like regurgitation
rose, incessant and regular as the beating
of a pulse.
</p><p class="calibre7">The jewelers leaned above the pit, and
peered down into webby darkness shot
with a doubtful glimmering that came
from an indiscernible source. They could
see nothing. A dank and musty odor
touched their nostrils, like the breath of
some long-sealed reservoir. It seemed to
them that the steady fountain-like noise <span><span id="calibre_link-15" data-page-number="638" data-page-name="Page:Weird Tales Volume 23 Issue 5 (1934 05).djvu/112" data-page-index="112" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Weird_Tales_Volume_23_Issue_5_(1934_05).djvu/112"></span></span>was only a few feet below in the shadows,
a little to one side of the opening.
</p><p class="calibre7">Neither of them could determine the
depth of the vault. After a brief consultation
they returned to their camel, which
was waiting stolidly at the palace entrance;
and removing the camel's harness
they knotted the long reins and leather
body-bands into a single thong that would
serve them in lieu of rope. Going badk to
the dais, they secured one end of this
thong to the fallen block, and lowered the
other into the dark pit.
</p><p class="calibre7">Milab descended hand over hand into
the depths for ten or twelve feet before his
toes encountered a solid surface. Still
gripping the thong cautiously, he found
himself on a level floor of stone. The
day was fast waning beyond the palace
walls; but a wan glimmer was afforded
by the hole in the pavement above; and
the outlines of a half -open door, sagging
at a ruinous angle, were revealed at one
side by the feeble twilight that entered
the vault from unknown crypts or stairs
beyond.
</p><p class="calibre7">While Marabac came nimbly down to
join him, Milab peered about for the
source of the water-like noise. Before
him in the undetermined shadows he discerned
the dim and puzzling contours of
an object that he could liken only to some
enormous clepsydra or fountain surrounded
with grotesque carvings.
</p><p class="calibre7">The light seemed to fail momently.
Unable to decide the nature of the object,
and having neither torch nor candle, he
tore a strip from the hem of his hempen
burnoose, and lit the slow-burning cloth
and held it aloft at arm's length before
him. By the dull, smoldering luminance
thus obtained, the jewelers beheld more
clearly the thing that bulked prodigious
and monstrous, rearing above them from
the fragment-littered floor to the shadowy
roof.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="smallcaps">he</span> thing was like some blasphemous
dream of a mad devil. Its main portion
or body was urn-like in form and
was pedestalled on a queerly tilted block
of stone at the vault's center. It was palish
and pitted with innumerable small
apertures. From its bosom and flattened
base many arm-like and leg-like projections
trailed in swollen nightmare segments
to the ground; and two other members,
sloping tautly, reached down like
roots into an open and seemingly empty
sarcophagus of gilded metal, graven with
weird archaic ciphers, that stood beside
the block.
</p><p class="calibre7">The urn-shaped torso was endowed
with two heads. One of these heads was
beaked like a cuttle-fish and was lined
with long oblique slits where the eyes
should have been. 'The other head, in
close juxtaposition on the narrow shoulders,
was that of an aged man, dark and
regal and terrible, whose burning eyes
were like balas-rubies and whose grizzled
beard had grown to the length of jungle
moss on the loathsomely porous trunk.
This trunk, on the side below the human
head, displayed a faint outline as of ribs;
and some of the members ended in human
hands and feet, or possessed anthropomorphic
jointings.
</p><p class="calibre7">Through heads, limbs and body there
ran recurrently the mysterious noise of
regurgitation that had drawn Milab and
Marabac to enter the vault. At each repetition
of the sound a slimy dew exuded
from the monstrous pores and rilled sluggishly
down in endless drops.
</p><p class="calibre7">The jewelers were held speechless and
immobile by a clammy terror. Unable to
avert their gaze, they met the baleful eyes
of the human head, glaring upon them
from its unearthly eminence. Then, as
the hempen strip in Milab's fingers burned
slowly away and failed to a red smolder,
and darkness gathered again in the vault, <span><span id="calibre_link-16" data-page-number="639" data-page-name="Page:Weird Tales Volume 23 Issue 5 (1934 05).djvu/113" data-page-index="113" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Weird_Tales_Volume_23_Issue_5_(1934_05).djvu/113"></span></span>they saw the blind slits in the other head open gradually, pouring forth a hot, yellow, intolerably flaming light as they expanded to immense round orbits. At the same time they heard a singular drum-like throbbing, as if the heart of the huge monster had become audible. 
</p><p class="calibre7">They knew only that a strange horror not of earth, or but partially of earth, was before them. The sight deprived them of thought and memory. Least of all did they remember the story-teller in Faraad, and the tale he had told concerning the hidden tomb of Ossaru and Nioth Korghai, and the prophecy of the tomb’s finding by those who should come to it unaware. 
</p><p class="calibre7">Swiftly, with a dreadful stretching and straightening, the monster lifted its foremost members, ending in the brown, 
shrivelled hands of an old man, and reached out toward the jewelers. From the cuttle-fish beak there issued a shrill demonian cackling; from the mouth of the kingly graybeard head a sonorous voice began to utter words of solemn cadence, like some enchanter’s rune, in a tongue unknown to Milab and Marabac. 
</p><p class="calibre7">They recoiled before the abhorrently groping hands. In a frenzy of fear and panic, by the streaming light of its incandescent orbs, they saw the anomaly rise and lumber forward from its stone seat, walking clumsily and uncertainly on 
its ill-assorted members. There was a trampling of elephantine pads&mdash;and a stumbling of human feet inadequate to bear up their share of the blasphemous hulk. The two stiffly sloping tentacles were withdrawn from the gold sarcophagus, their ends muffled by empty, jewel-sown cloths of a precious purple, such as would be used for the winding of some royal mummy. With a ceaseless and insane cackling, a malign thundering as of curses that broke to senile quavers, the double-deaded horror leaned toward Milab and Marabac. 
</p><p class="calibre7">Turning, they ran wildly across the roomy vault. Before them, illumined now by the pouring rays from the monster’s orbits, they saw the half-open door of somber metal whose bolts and hinges had rusted away, permitting it to sag inward. The door was of cyclopean height and breadth, as if designed for beings huger than man. Beyond it were the dim reaches of a twilight corridor. 
</p><p class="calibre7">Five paces from the doorway there was a faint red line that followed the chamber’s conformation on the dusty floor. Marabac, a little ahead of his brother, crossed the line. As if checked in midair by some invisible wall, he faltered and stopped. His limbs and body seemed to melt away beneath the burnoose&mdash;the burnoose itself became tattered as with incalculable age. Dust floated on the air in a tenuous cloud, and there was a momentary gleaming of white bones where his outflung hands had been. Then the bones too were gone&mdash;and an empty heap of rags lay rotting on the floor. 
</p><p class="calibre7">A faint odor as of corruption rose to the nostrils of Milab. Uncomprehending, he had checked his own flight for an instant. Then, on his shoulders, he felt the grasp of slimy, withered hands. The cackling and muttering of the heads was like a demon chorus behind him. The drum-like beating, the noise of rising fountains, were loud in his ears. With one swiftly dying scream he followed Marabac over the red line. 
</p><p class="calibre7">The enormity that was both man and 
star-born monster, the nameless amalgam of an unearthly resurrection, still lumbered on and did not pause. With the hands of that Ossam who had forgotten his own enchantment, it reached for the two piles of empty rags. Reaching, it entered the zone of death and dissolution <span><span id="calibre_link-17" data-page-number="640" data-page-name="Page:Weird Tales Volume 23 Issue 5 (1934 05).djvu/114" data-page-index="114" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Weird_Tales_Volume_23_Issue_5_(1934_05).djvu/114"></span></span>which Ossaru himself had established to guard the vault for ever. For an instant, on the air, there was a melting as of misshapen cloud, a falling as of light ashes. After that the darkness returned, and with the darkness, silence,
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">N</span></span></span><span class="smallcaps">ight</span> settled above that nameless land, that forgotten city; and with its coming the Ghorii, who had followed Milab and Marabac over the desert plain. Swiftly they slew and ate the camel that waited patiently at the palace entrance. Later, in the old hall of columns, they found that opening in the dais through which the jewelers had descended. Hungrily they gathered about the hole, sniffing at the tomb beneath. Then, baffled, they went away, their keen nostrils telling them that the scent was lost, that the tomb was <span title="[sic] &apos;empty&apos;" class="calibre17">empy</span> either of life or death.
