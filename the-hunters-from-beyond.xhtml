the allurement of a bookstore,
particularly one that is
well supplied with rare and
exotic items. Therefore I turned in
at Toleman's to browse around for
a few minutes. I had come to San
Francisco for one of my brief, biannual
visits, and had started early
that idle forenoon
to an appointment
with
Cyprian Sincaul,
the sculptor, a
second or third
cousin of mine, whom I had not
seen for several years.

<p class="calibre8">His studio was only a block from
Toleman's, and there seemed to be
no especial object in reaching it
ahead of time. Cyprian had offered
to show me his collection of recent
sculptures; but, remembering the
smooth mediocrity of his former
work, amid
which were a
few banal efforts
to achieve horror
and grotes-querie,
I did not <span><span id="calibre_link-12" data-page-number="293" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/7" data-page-index="7" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/7"></span></span>anticipate anything more than an
hour or two of dismal boredom.
</p><p class="calibre8">The little shop was empty of customers.
Knowing my proclivities,
the owner and his one assistant became
tacitly non-attentive after a
word of recognition, and left me to
rummage at will among the curiously
laden shelves. Wedged in between
other but less alluring titles,
I found a de-luxe edition of Goya's
"Proverbes." I began to turn the
heavy pages, and was soon engrossed
in the diabolic art of these
nightmare-nurtured drawings.
</p><p class="calibre8">It has always been incomprehensible
to me that I did not shriek
aloud with mindless, overmastering
terror, when I happened to look up
from the volume, and saw the thing
that was crouching in a corner of
the book-shelves before me. I could
not have been more hideously startled
if some hellish conception of
Goya had suddenly come to life
and emerged from one of the pictures
in the folio.
</p><p class="calibre8">What I saw was a forwardslouching,
vermin-gray figure,
wholly devoid of hair or down or
bristles, but marked with faint,
etiolated rings like those of a serpent
that has lived in darkness. It
possessed the head and brow of an
anthropoid ape, a semi-canine
mouth and jaw, and arms ending in
twisted hands whose black hyena
talons nearly scraped the floor. The
thing was infinitely bestial, and, at
the same time, macabre; for its
parchment skin was shriveled,
corpselike, mummified, in a manner
impossible to convey; and from eye
sockets well-nigh deep as those of
a skull, there glimmered evil slits
of yellowish phosphorescence, like
burning sulphur. Fangs that were
stained as if with poison or gangrene,
issued from the slavering,
half-open mouth; and the whole attitude
of the creature was that of
some maleficent monster in readiness
to spring.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">hough</span> I had been for years
a professional writer of stories
that often dealt with occult phenomena,
with the weird and the
spectral, I was not at this time possessed
of any clear and settled belief
regarding such phenomena. I
had never before seen anything that
I could identify as a phantom, nor
even an hallucination; and I should
hardly have said offhand that a
bookstore on a busy street, in full
summer daylight, was the likeliest
of places in which to see one. But
the thing before me was assuredly
nothing that could ever exist among
the permissible forms of a sane
world. It was too horrific, too atrocious,
to be anything but a creation
of unreality.
</p><p class="calibre8">Even as I stared across the Goya,
sick with a half-incredulous fear,
the apparition moved toward me. I
say that it moved, but its change of
position was so instantaneous, so
utterly without effort or visible
transition, that the verb is hopelessly
inadequate. The foul specter
had seemed five or six feet away.
But now it was stooping directly
above the volume that I still held
in my hands, with its loathesomely
lambent eyes peering upward at my
face, and a gray-green slime drooling
from its mouth on the broad
pages. At the same time I breathed
an insupportable fetor, like a mingling
of rancid serpent-stench with
the moldiness of antique charnels
and the fearsome reek of newly decaying
carrion.
</p><p class="calibre8">In a frozen timelessness that was
perhaps no more than a second or
two, my heart appeared to suspend
its beating, while I beheld the
ghastly face. Gasping, I let the
Goya drop with a resonant bang on
the floor, and even as it fell, I saw
that the vision had vanished.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">oleman</span>, a tonsured gnome
with shell-rimmed goggles,
rushed forward to retrieve the  <span><span id="calibre_link-13" data-page-number="294" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/8" data-page-index="8" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/8"></span></span>fallen volume, exclaiming: "What is
wrong, Mr. Hastane? Are you ill?"
From the meticulousness with
which he examined the binding in
search of possible damage, I knew
that his chief solicitude was concerning
the Goya. It was plain that
neither he nor his clerk had seen
the phantom; nor could I detect
aught in their demeanor to indicate
that they had noticed the mephitic
odor that still lingered in the air
like an exhalation from broken
graves. And, as far as I could tell,
they did not even perceive the grayish
slime that still polluted the
open folio.
</p><p class="calibre8">I do not remember how I managed
to make my exit from the
shop. My mind had become a seething
blur of muddled horror, of
crawling, sick revulsion from the
supernatural vileness I had beheld,
together with the direst apprehension
for my own sanity and safety.
I recall only that I found myself on
the street above Toleman's, walking
with feverish rapidity toward my
cousin's studio, with a neat parcel
containing the Goya volume under
my arm. Evidently, in an effort to
atone for my clumsiness, I must
have bought and paid for the book
by a sort of automatic impulse,
without any real awareness of what
I was doing.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span> <span class="calibre15">came</span>}} to the building in which
was my destination, but went on
around the block several times before
entering. All the while I
fought desperately to regain my
self-control and equipoise. I remember
how difficult it was even
to moderate the pace at which I
was walking, or refrain from breaking
into a run; for it seemed to me
that I was fleeing all the time from
an invisible pursuer. I tried to argue
with myself, to convince the
rational part of my mind that the
apparition had been the product of
some evanescent trick of light and
shade, or a temporary dimming of
eyesight. But such sophistries were
useless; for I had seen the gargoyl-ish
terror all too distinctly, in an
unforgettable fullness of grisly detail.
</p><p class="calibre8">What could the thing mean? I
had never used narcotic drugs or
abused alcohol. My nerves, as far
as I knew, were in sound condition.
But either I had suffered a visual
hallucination that might mark the
beginning of some obscure cerebral
disorder, or had been visited by a
spectral phenomenon, by something
from realms and dimensions that
are past the normal scope of human
perception. It was a problem either
for the alienist or the occultist.
</p><p class="calibre8">Though I was still damnably upset,
I contrived to regain a nominal
composure of my faculties.
Also, it occurred to me that the unimaginative
portrait busts and tamely
symbolic figure-groups of Cyprian
Sincaul might serve admirably
to soothe my shaken nerves.
Even his grotesques would seem
sane and ordinary by comparison
with the blasphemous gargoyle that
had drooled before me in the bookshop.
</p><p class="calibre8">I entered the studio building, and
climbed a worn stairway to the second
floor, where Cyprian had established
himself in a somewhat capacious
suite of rooms. As I went up
the stairs, I had the peculiar feeling
that somebody was climbing
them just ahead of me; but I could
neither see nor hear anyone, and
the hall above was no less silent
and empty than the stairs.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">C</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">yprian</span> was in his atelier
when I knocked. After an interval
which seemed unduly long, I
heard him call out, telling me to
enter. I found him wiping his
hands on an old cloth, and surmised
that he had been modeling.
A sheet of light burlap had been
thrown over what was plainly an <span><span id="calibre_link-14" data-page-number="295" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/9" data-page-index="9" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/9"></span></span>ambitious but unfinished group of
figures, which occupied the center
of the long room. All around were
other sculptures, in clay, bronze,
marble, and even the terra-cotta and
steatite which he sometimes employed
for his less conventional
conceptions. At one end of the
room there stood a heavy Chinese
screen.
</p><p class="calibre8">At a single glance I realized that
a great change had occurred, both
in Cyprian Sincaul and his work.
I remembered him as an amiable,
somewhat flabby-looking youth, always
dapperly dressed, with no
trace of the dreamer or visionary.
It was hard to recognize him new,
for he had become lean, harsh, vehement,
with an air of pride and
penetration that was almost Luciferian.
His unkempt mane of hair
was already shot with white, and
his eyes were electrically brilliant
with a strange knowledge, and yet
somehow were vaguely furtive, as
if there dwelt behind them a morbid
and macabre fear.
</p><p class="calibre8">The change in his sculpture was
no less striking. The respectable
tameness and polished mediocrity
were gone, and in their place, incredibly,
was something little short
of genius. More unbelievable still,
in view of the laboriously ordinary
grotesques of his earlier phase, was
the trend that his art had now
taken. All around me were frenetic,
murderous demons, satyrs mad with
nympholepsy, ghouls that seemed
to sniff the odors of the charnel,
lamias voluptuously coiled about
their victims, and less namable
things that belonged to the outland
realms of evil myth and malign
superstition.
</p><p class="calibre8">Sin, horror, blasphemy, diablerie&mdash;the
lust and malice of pandemonium&mdash;all
had been caught with impeccable
art. The potent nightmarishness
of these creations was
not calculated to reassure my trembling
nerves; and all at once I felt
an imperative desire to escape from
the studio, to flee from the baleful
throng of frozen cacodemons and
chiseled chimeras.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">M</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">y</span> expression must have betrayed
my feelings to some
extent.
</p><p class="calibre8">"Pretty strong work, aren't they?"
said Cyprian, in a loud, vibrant
voice, with a note of harsh pride
and triumph. "I can see that you
are surprised&mdash;you didn't look for
anything of the sort, I dare say."
</p><p class="calibre8">"No, candidly, I didn't," I admitted.
"Good Lord, man, you will become
the Michelangelo of diabolism
if you go on at this rate. Where
on earth do you get such stuff?"
</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I've gone pretty far," said
Cyprian, seeming to disregard my
question. "Further even than you
think, probably. If you could know
what I know, could see what I have
seen, you might make something
really worth-while out of your
weird fiction, Philip. You are very
clever and imaginative, of course.
But you've never had any experience."
</p><p class="calibre8">I was startled and puzzled. "Experience?
What do you mean?"
</p><p class="calibre8">"Precisely that. You try to depict
the occult and the supernatural
without even the most rudimentary
first-hand knowledge of them.
I tried to do something of the same
sort in sculpture, years ago, without
knowledge; and doubtless you
recall the mediocre mess that I
made of it. But I've learned a thing
or two since then."
</p><p class="calibre8">"Sounds as if you had made the
traditional bond with the devil, or
something of that sort," I observed,
with a feeble and perfunctory levity.
</p><p class="calibre8">Cyprian's eyes narrowed slightly,
with a strange, secret look.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I know what I know. Never
mind how or why. The world in
which we live isn't the only world;
and some of the others lie closer at <span><span id="calibre_link-15" data-page-number="296" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/10" data-page-index="10" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/10"></span></span>hand than you think. The boundaries
of the seen and the unseen
are sometimes interchangeable."
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">R</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">ecalling</span> the malevolent
phantom, I felt a peculiar disquietude
as I listened to his words.
An hour before, his statement
would have impressed me as mere
theorizing, but now it assumed an
ominous and terrifying significance.
</p><p class="calibre8">"What makes you think I have
had no experience of the occult?" I
asked.
</p><p class="calibre8">"Your stories hardly show anything
of the kind&mdash;anything factual
or personal. They are all palpably
made up. When you've argued with
a ghost, oi watched the ghouls at
mealtime, or fought with an incubus,
or suckled a vampire, you may
achieve some genius characterization
and color along such lines."
</p><p class="calibre8">For reasons that should be fairly
obvious, I had not intended to tell
anyone of the unbelievable thing
at Toleman's. Now, with a singular
mixture of emotions, of compulsive,
eery terrors and desire to refute
the animal versions of Cyprian,
I found myself describing the phantom.
</p><p class="calibre8">He listened with an inexpressive
look, as if his thoughts were occupied
with other matters than my
story. Then, when I had finished:
</p><p class="calibre8">"You are becoming more psychic
than I imagined. Was your apparition
anything like one of these?"
</p><p class="calibre8">With the last words, he lifted the
sheet of burlap from the muffled
group of figures beside which he
had been standing.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span> <span class="calibre15">cried</span> out involuntarily with
the shock of that appalling revelation,
and almost tottered as I
stepped back.
</p><p class="calibre8">Before me, in a monstrous semicircle,
were seven creatures who
might all have been modeled from
the gargoyle that had confronted
me across the folio of Goya drawings.
Even in several that were still
amorphous or incomplete, Cyprian
had conveyed with a damnable art
the peculiar mingling of primal
bestiality and mortuary putrescence
that had signalized the phantom.
The seven monsters had closed in
on a cowering, naked girl, and were
all clutching foully toward her
with their hyena claws. The stark,
frantic, insane terror on the face of
the girl, and the slavering hunger
of her assailants, were alike unbearable.
The group was a masterpiece,
in its consummate power of technique&mdash;but
a masterpiece that inspired
loathing rather than admiration.
And following my recent experience,
the sight of it affected me
with indescribable alarm. It seemed
to me that I had gone astray from
the normal, familiar world into a
land of detestable mystery, of prodigious
and unnatural menace.
</p><p class="calibre8">Held by an abhorrent fascination,
it was hard for me to wrench my
eyes away from the figure-piece. At
last I turned from it to Cyprian
himself. He was regarding me with
a cryptic air, beneath which I suspected
a covert gloating.
</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you like my little pets?"
he inquired. "I am going to call
the composition 'The Hunters from
Beyond.'"
</p><p class="calibre8">Before I could answer, a woman
suddenly appeared from behind the
Chinese screen. I saw that she was
the model for the girl in the unfinished
group. Evidently she had
been dressing, and she was now
ready to leave, for she wore a tailored
suit and a smart toque. She
was beautiful, in a dark, semi-Latin
fashion; but her mouth was
sullen and reluctant, and her wide,
liquid eyes were wells of strange
terror as she gazed at Cyprian, myself
and the uncovered statue-piece.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">C</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">yprian</span> did not introduce me.
He and the girl talked together
in low tones for a minute or <span><span id="calibre_link-16" data-page-number="297" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/11" data-page-index="11" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/11"></span></span>two, and I was unable to overhear
more than half of what they said.
I gathered, however, that an appointment
was being made for the
next sitting. There was a pleading,
frightened note in the girl's voice,
together with an almost maternal
concern; and Cyprian seemed to be
arguing with her or trying to reassure
her about something. At
last she went out, with a queer, supplicative
glance at me&mdash;a glance
whose meaning I could only surmise
and could not wholly fathom.
</p><p class="calibre8">"That was Marta," said Cyprian.
"She is half Irish, half Italian. A
good model; but my new sculptures
seem to be making her a little nervous."
He laughed abruptly, with a
mirthless, jarring note that was like
the cachinnation of a sorcerer.
</p><p class="calibre8">"In God's name, what are you
trying to do here?" I burst out.
"What does it all mean? Do such
abominations really exist, on earth
or in any hell?"
</p><p class="calibre8">He laughed again, with an evil
subtlety, and became evasive all at
once. "Anything may exist, in a
boundless universe with multiple
dimensions. Anything may be real&mdash;or
unreal. Who knows? It is not
for me to say. Figure it out for
yourself, if you can&mdash;there's a vast
field for speculation&mdash;and perhaps
for more than speculation."
</p><p class="calibre8">With this, he began immediately
to talk of other topics. Baffled, mystified,
with a sorely troubled mind
and nerves that were more unstrung
than ever by the black enigma
of it all, I ceased to question
him. Simultaneously, my desire to
leave the studio became almost
overwhelming&mdash;a mindless, whirlwind
panic that prompted me to
run pell-mell from the room and
down the stairs into the wholesome
normality of the common, Twentieth
Century streets. It seemed to
me that the rays which fell through
the skylight were not those of the
sun, but of some darker orb; that
the room was touched with unclean
webs of shadows where shadow
should not have been; that the stone
Satans, the bronze lamias, the terracotta
satyrs and the clay gargoyles
had somehow increased in number
and might spring to malignant life
at any instant.
</p><p class="calibre8">Hardly knowing what I said, I
continued to converse for a while
with Cyprian. Then, excusing myself
on the score of a nonexistent
luncheon appointment, and promising
vaguely to return for another
visit before my departure from the
city, I took my leave.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span> <span class="calibre15">was</span> surprised to find my cousin's
model in the lower hall, at
the foot of the stairway. From her
manner, and her first words, it was
plain that she had been waiting.
</p><p class="calibre8">"You are Mr. Philip Hastane,
aren't you?" she said, in an eager,
agitated voice. "I am Marta Fitzgerald.
Cyprian has often mentioned
you, and I believe that he admires
you a lot.
</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe you'll think me crazy,"
she went on, "but I had to speak
to you. I can't stand the way that
things are going here, and I'd refuse
to come to the place any more,
if it wasn't that I&mdash;like Cyprian so
well.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know what he has done&mdash;or
what has been done to him&mdash;but
he is altogether different from what
he used to be. His new work is so
horrible&mdash;you can't imagine how it
frightens me. The sculptures he
does are more hideous, more hellish
all the time. Ugh! those drooling,
dead-gray monsters in that new
group of his&mdash;I can hardly bear to
be in the studio with them. It isn't
right for anyone to depict such
things. Don't you think they are
awful, Mr. Hastane? They look
as if they had broken loose from
hell&mdash;and make you think that hell
can't be very far away. It is wrong
and wicked for anyone to&mdash;even <span><span id="calibre_link-17" data-page-number="298" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/12" data-page-index="12" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/12"></span></span>imagine them; and I wish that Cyprian
would stop. I am afraid that
something will happen to him&mdash;to
his mind&mdash;if he goes on. And I'll
go mad, too, if I have to see those
monsters many more times. My
God! No one could keep sane in
that studio."
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">S</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">he</span> paused, and appeared to
hesitate. Then:
</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't you do something, Mr.
Hastane? Can't you talk to him,
and tell him how wrong it is, and
how dangerous to his mental
health? You must have a lot of influence
with Cyprian&mdash;you are his
cousin, aren't you? And he thinks
you are very clever, too. I wouldn't
ask you, if I hadn't been forced to
notice so many things that aren't as
they should be.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I wouldn't bother you, either, if
I knew anyone else to ask. He has
shut himself up in that awful studio
for the past year, and he hardly
ever sees anybody. You are the first
person that he has invited to see
his new sculptures. He wants them
to be a complete surprise for the
critics and the public, when he
holds his next exhibition.
</p><p class="calibre8">"But you'll speak to Cyprian,
won't you, Mr. Hastane? I can't do
anything to stop him&mdash;he seems to
exult in the mad horrors he creates.
And he merely laughs at me when I
try to tell him the danger. However,
I think that those things are
making him a little nervous sometimes&mdash;that
he is growing afraid of
his own morbid imagination. Perhaps
he will listen to you."
</p><p class="calibre8">If I had needed anything more to
unnerve me, the desperate pleading
of the girl and her dark, obscurely
baleful hintings would have been
enough. I could see that she loved
Cyprian, that she was frantically
anxious concerning him, and hysterically
afraid; otherwise, she
would not have approached an utter
stranger in this fashion.
</p><p class="calibre8">"But I haven't any influence with
Cyprian," I protested, feeling a
queer embarrassment. "And what
am I to say to him, anyway? Whatever
he is doing is his own affair,
not mine. His new sculptures are
magnificent&mdash;I have never seen anything
more powerful of the kind.
And how could I advise him to stop
doing them? There would be no
legitimate reason; he would simply
laugh me out of the studio. An artist
has the right to choose his own
subject-matter, even if he takes it
from the nether pits of Limbo and
Erebus."
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">he</span> girl must have pleaded and
argued with me for many minutes
in that deserted hall. Listening
to her, and trying to convince her
of my inability to fulfil her request,
was like a dialog in some futile
and tedious nightmare. During the
course of it, she told me a few details
that I am unwilling to record
in this narrative; details that were
too morbid and too shocking for belief,
regarding the mental alteration
of Cyprian, and his new subject-matter
and method of work. There
were direct and oblique hints of a
growing perversion; but somehow
it seemed that much more was being
held back; that even in her
most horrifying disclosures she was
not wholly frank with me. At last,
with some sort of hazy promise that
I would speak to Cyprian, would
remonstrate with him, I succeeded
in getting away from her, and returned
to my hotel.
</p><p class="calibre8">The afternoon and evening that
followed were tinged as by the tyrrannous
adumbration of an ill
dream. I felt that I had stepped
from the solid earth into a gulf of
seething, menacing, madness-haunted
shadow, and was lost henceforward
to all rightful sense of location
or direction. It was all too
hideous&mdash;and too doubtful and unreal.
The change in Cyprian  <span><span id="calibre_link-18" data-page-number="299" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/13" data-page-index="13" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/13"></span></span>self was no less bewildering, and
hardly less horrifying, than the vile
phantom of the bookshop, and the
demon sculptures that displayed a
magisterial art. It was as if the
man had become possessed by some
satanic energy or entity.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">E</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">verywhere</span> that I went, I
was powerless to shake off
the feeling of an intangible pursuit,
of a frightful, unseen vigilance. It
seemed to me that the worm-gray
face and sulphurous eyes would reappear
at any moment; that the
semi-canine mouth with its gangrene-dripping
fangs might come to
slaver above the restaurant table at
which I ate, or upon the pillow of
my bed. I did not dare to reopen
the purchased Goya volume, for
fear of finding that certain pages
were still defiled with a spectral
slime.
</p><p class="calibre8">I went out and spent the evening
in cafÃ©s, in theaters, wherever people
thronged and lights were bright.
It was after midnight when I finally
ventured to brave the solitude of
my hotel bedroom. Then there were
endless hours of nerve-wrung insomnia,
of shivering, sweating apprehension
beneath the electric
bulb that I had left burning. Finally,
a little before dawn, by no conscious
transition and with no premonitory
drowsiness, I fell asleep.
</p><p class="calibre8">I remember no dreams&mdash;only the
vast, incubus-like oppression that
persisted even in the depth of slumber,
as if to drag me down with its
formless, ever-clinging weight into
gulfs beyond the reach of created
light or the fathoming of organized
entity.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">t</span> was almost noon when I
awoke, and found myself staring
into the verminous, apish, mummy-dead
face and hell-illumined
eyes of the gargoyle that had
crouched before me in the corner
at Toleman's. The thing was standing
at the foot of my bed; lind behind
it as I stared, the wall of the
room, which was covered with a
floral paper, dissolved in an infinite
vista of grayness, teeming with
ghoulish forms that emerged like
monstrous, misshapen bubbles from
plains of undulant ooze and skies
of serpentine vapor. It was another
world, and my very sense of equilibrium
was disturbed by an evil
vertigo as I gazed. It seemed to me
that my bed was heaving dizzily,
was turning slowly, deliriously toward
the gulf; that the feculent
vista and the vile apparition were
swimming beneath me; that I would
fall toward them in another moment
and be precipitated forever
into that world of abysmal monstrosity
and obscenity.
</p><p class="calibre8">In a start of profound alarm, I
fought my vertigo, fought the sense
that another will than mine was
drawing me, that the unclean gargoyle
was luring me by some unspeakable
mesmeric spell, as a serpent
is said to lure its prey. I
seemed to read a nameless purpose
in its yellow-slitted eyes, in the
soundless moving of its oozy lips;
and my very soul recoiled with
nausea and revulsion as I breathed
its pestilential fetor.
</p><p class="calibre8">Apparently, the mere effort of
mental resistance was enough. The
vista and the face receded; they
went out in a swirl of daylight. I
saw the design of tea roses on the
wallpaper beyond; and the bed beneath
me was sanely horizontal
once more. I lay sweating with my
terror, all adrift on a sea of nightmare
surmise, of unearthly threat
and whirlpool madness, till the
ringing of the telephone bell recalled
me automatically to the
known world.
</p><p class="calibre8">I sprang to answer the call. It
was Cyprian, though I should hardly
have recognized the dead, hopeless
tones of his voice, from which
the mad pride and self-assurance of <span><span id="calibre_link-19" data-page-number="300" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/14" data-page-index="14" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/14"></span></span>the previous day had wholly vanished.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I must see you at once," he said.
"Can you come to the studio?"
</p><p class="calibre8">I was about to refuse, to tell him
that I had been called home suddenly,
that there was no time, that
I must catch the noon train&mdash;anything
to avert the ordeal of another
visit to that place of mephitic evil&mdash;when
I heard his voice again.
</p><p class="calibre8">"You simply must come, Philip. I
can't tell you about it over the
phone, but a dreadful thing has
happened: Marta has disappeared."
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span> <span class="calibre15">consented</span>, telling him that
I would start for the studio as
soon as I had dressed. The whole
nightmare had closed in, had deepened
immeasurably with his last
words; but, remembering the haunted
face of the girl, her hysteric
fears, her frantic plea and my vague
promise, I could not very well decline
to go.
</p><p class="calibre8">I dressed and went out with my
mind in a turmoil of abominable
conjecture, of ghastly doubt, and
apprehension all the more hideous
because I was unsure of its object.
I tried to imagine what had happened,
tried to piece together the
frightful, evasive, half-admitted
hints of unknown terror into a
tangible coherent fabric, but found
myself involved in a chaos of shadowy
menace.
</p><p class="calibre8">I could not have eaten any breakfast,
even if I had taken the necessary
time. I went at once to the
studio, and found Cyprian standing
aimlessly amid his baleful statuary.
His look was that of a man who has
been stunned by the blow of some
crushing weapon, or has gazed on
the very face of Medusa. He
greeted me in a vacant manner,
with dull, toneless words. Then,
like a charged machine, as if his
body rather than his mind were
speaking, he began at once to pour
forth the atrocious narrative.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span class="dropinitial-fl">"</span><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">hey</span> took her," he said, simply.
"Maybe you didn't know
it, or weren't sure of it; but I've
been doing all my new sculptures
from life&mdash;even that last group.
Marta was posing for me this forenoon&mdash;only
an hour ago&mdash;or less. I
had hoped to finish her part of
the modeling to-day; and she
wouldn't have had to come again
for this particular piece. I hadn't
called the Things this time, since I
knew she was beginning to fear
them more and more. I think she
feared them on my account more
than her own&mdash;and they were making
me a little uneasy too, by the
boldness with which they sometimes
lingered when I had ordered them
to leave, and the way they would
sometimes appear when I didn't
want them.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I was busy with some of the final
touches on the girl-figure, and
wasn't even looking at Marta, when
suddenly I knew that the Things
were there. The smell told me, if
nothing else&mdash;I guess you know
what the smell is like. I looked up,
and found that the studio was full
of them&mdash;they had never before appeared
in such numbers. They were
surrounding Marta, were crowding
and jostling each other, were all
reaching toward her with their
filthy talons; but even then, I didn't
think that they could harm her.
They aren't material beings, in the
sense that we are, and they really
have no physical power outside
their own plane. All that they do
have is a sort of snaky mesmerism,
and they'll always try to drag you
down to their own dimension by
means of it. God help anyone who
yields to them; but you don't have
to go, unless you are weak, or willing.
I've never had any doubt of
my power to resist them, and I
didn't really dream they could do
anything to Marta.
</p><p class="calibre8">"It startled me, though, when I
saw the whole crowding hell-pack, <span><span id="calibre_link-20" data-page-number="301" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/15" data-page-index="15" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/15"></span></span>and I ordered them to go pretty
sharply. I was angry&mdash;and somewhat
alarmed, too. But they merely
grimaced and slavered, with that
slow, twisting movement of their
lips that is like a voiceless gibbering,
and then they closed in on
Marta, just as I represented them
doing in that accursed group of
sculpture. Only there were scores
of them now, instead of merely
seven.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span class="dropinitial-fl">"</span><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">can't</span> describe how it hap-A
pened, but all at once their foul
talons had reached the girl; they
were pawing her, were pulling at
her hands, her arms, her body. She
screamed&mdash;and I hope I'll never
hear another scream so full of black
agony and soul-unhinging fright.
Then I knew that she had yielded
to them&mdash;either from choice, or
from excess of terror&mdash;and knew
that they were taking her away.
</p><p class="calibre8">"For a moment, the studio wasn't
there at all&mdash;only a long, gray, oozing
plain, beneath skies where the
fumes of hell were writhing like a
million ghostly and distorted dragons.
Marta was sinking into that
ooze, and the Things were all about
her, gathering in fresh hundreds
from every side, fighting each other
for place, sinking with her like
bloated, misshaped fen-creatures
into their native slime. Then everything
vanished&mdash;and I was standing
here in the studio, all alone with
these damned sculptures."
</p><p class="calibre8">He paused for a little, and stared
with dreary, desolate eyes at the
floor. Then:
</p><p class="calibre8">"It was awful, Philip, and I'll
never forgive myself for having
anything to do with those monsters.
I must have been a little mad, but
I've always had a strong ambition
to create some real stuff in the
field of the grotesque and visionary
and macabre. I don't suppose you
ever suspected, back in my studgy
phase, that I had a veritable appetence
for such things. I wanted to
do in sculpture what Poe and Lovecraft
and Baudelaire have done in
literature, what Rops and Goya did
in pictorial art.
</p><p class="calibre8">"That was what led me into the
occult, when I realized my limitations.
I knew that I had to <i class="calibre9">see</i> the
dwellers of the invisible worlds before
I could depict them. I wanted
to do it. I longed for this power
of vision and representation more
than anything else. And then, all
at once, I found that I had the
power of summoning the unseen<span class="nowrap">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span class="dropinitial-fl">"</span><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">here</span> was no magic involved,
in the usual sense of
the world&mdash;no spells and circles,
no pentacles and burning gums
from old sorcery books. At bottom,
it was just will-power, I guess&mdash;a
will to divine the satanic, to summon
the innumerable malignities
and grotesqueries that people other
planes than ours, or mingle unperceived
with humanity.
</p><p class="calibre8">"You've no idea what I have beheld,
Philip. These statues of mine&mdash;these
devils, vampires, lamias,
satyrs&mdash;were all done from life, or,
at least from recent memory. The
originals are what the occultists
would call elementals, I suppose.
There are endless worlds, contiguous
to our own, or coexisting with
it, that such beings inhabit. All
the creations of myth and fantasy,
all the familiar spirits that sorcerers
have evoked, are resident in
these worlds.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I made myself their master, I
levied upon them at will. Then,
from a dimension that must be a
little lower than all others, a little
nearer the ultimate nadir of hell, I
called the innominate beings who
posed for this new figure-piece.
</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know what they are, but
I have surmised a good deal. They
are hateful as the worms of the Pit,
they are malevolent as harpies,
they drool with a poisonous hunger <span><span id="calibre_link-21" data-page-number="302" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/16" data-page-index="16" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/16"></span></span>not to be named or imagined. But I
believed that they were powerless
to do anything outside their own
sphere, and I've always laughed at
them when they tried to entice me&mdash;even
though that snakish mental
pull of theirs was rather creepy at
times. It was as if soft, invisible,
gelatinous arms were trying to drag
you down from the firm shore into
a bottomless bog.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span class="dropinitial-fl">"</span><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">T</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">hey</span> are hunters&mdash;I am sure
of that&mdash;the hunters from Beyond.
God knows what they will
do to Marta now that they have her
at their mercy. That vast, viscid,
miasma-haunted place to which they
took her is awful beyond the imagining
of a, Satan. Perhaps&mdash;even
there&mdash;they couldn't harm her body.
But bodies aren't what they want&mdash;it
isn't for human flesh that they
grope with those ghoulish claws,
and gape and slaver with those gangrenous
mouths. The brain itself&mdash;and
the soul, too&mdash;is their food:
they are the creatures who prey on
the minds of madmen and madwomen,
who devour the disembodied
spirits that have fallen from
the cycles of incarnation, have
gone down beyond the possibility
of rebirth.
</p><p class="calibre8">"To think of Marta in their
power&mdash;it is worse than hell or
madness. Marta loved me, and I
loved her, too, though I didn't have
the sense to realize it, wrapped as I
was in my dark, baleful ambition
and impious egotism. She was
afraid for me, and I believe she surrendered
voluntarily to the Things.
She must have thought that they
would leave me alone if they secured
another victim in my place."
</p><p class="calibre8">He ceased, and began to pace idly
and feverishly about. I saw that
his hollow eyes were alight with
torment, as if the mechanical telling
of his horrible story had in
some manner served to requicken
his crushed mind. Utterly and
starkly appalled by his hideous revelations,
I could say nothing, but
could only stand and watch his torture-twisted
face.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">I</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">ncredibly</span>, his expression
changed, with a wild, startled
look that was instantly transfigured
into joy. Turning to follow his
gaze, I saw that Marta was standing
in the center of the room. She
was nude, except for a Spanish
shawl that she must have worn
while posing. Her face was bloodless
as the marble of a tomb, and
her eyes were wide and blank, as if
she had been drained of all life, of
all thought or emotion or memory,
as if even the knowledge of horror
had been taken away from her. It
was the face of the living dead, the
soulless mask of ultimate idiocy;
and the joy faded from Cyprian's
eyes as he stepped toward her.
</p><p class="calibre8">He took her in his arms, he spoke
to her with a desperate, loving tenderness,
with cajoling and caressing
words. She made no answer, however,
no movement of recognition
or awareness, but stared beyond him
with her blank eyes, to which the
daylight and the darkness, the void
air and her lover's face, would
henceforward be the same. He and
I both knew, in that instant, that
she would never; again respond to
any human voice, or to human love
or terror; that she was like an
empty cerement, retaining the outward
form of that which the worms
have eaten in their mausolean darkness.
Of the noisome pits wherein
she had been, of that bournless
realm and its pullulating phantoms,
she could tell us nothing: her
agony had ended with the terrible
mercy of complete forgetfulness.
</p>
<div class="wst-dhr">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">L</span></span></span><span class="calibre15">ike</span> one who confronts the
Gorgon, I was frozen by her
wide and sightless gaze. Then, behind
her, where stood an array of
carven Satans and lamias, the room <span><span id="calibre_link-22" data-page-number="303" data-page-name="Page:Strange Tales Volume 02 Number 03 (1932-10).djvu/17" data-page-index="17" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Strange_Tales_Volume_02_Number_03_(1932-10).djvu/17"></span></span>seemed to recede, the walls and
floor dissolved in a seething, unfathomable
gulf, amid whose pestilential
vapors the statues were mingled
in momentary and loathsome
ambiguity with the ravening faces,
the hunger-contorted forms that
swirled toward us from their ultradimensional
limbo like a devil-laden
hurricane from Malebolge.
Outlined against that boiling, measureless
cauldron of malignant
storm, Marta stood like an image of
glacial death and silence in the
arms of Cyprian. Then, once more,
after a little, the abhorrent vision
faded, leaving only the diabolic-statuary.
</p><p class="calibre8">I think that I alone had beheld
it; that Cyprian had seen nothing
but the dead face of Marta. He
drew her close, he repeated his
hopeless words of tenderness and
cajolery. Then, suddenly, he released
her with a vehement sob of
despair. Turning away, while she
stood and still looked on with unseeing
eyes, he snatched a heavy
sculptor's mallet from the table on
which it was lying, and proceeded
to smash with furious blows the
newly-modeled group of gargoyles,
till nothing was left but the figure
of the terror-maddened girl, crouching
above a mass of cloddish fragments
and formless, half-dried clay.
