mansion of considerable size
and dignity, set among oaks
and cypresses on the hill behind Auburn's
Chinatown, in what had once
been the aristocratic section of the
village. At the time of which I wrote,
it had been unoccupied for several
years and had begun to present the
signs of desolation and dilapidation
which untenanted houses so soon display.
The place had a tragic history
and was believed to be haunted. I
had never been able to procure any
first-hand or precise accounts of the
spectral manifestations that were  <span><span id="calibre_link-12" data-page-number="110" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/110" data-page-index="110" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/110"></span></span>credited to it. But certainly it possessed
all the necessary antecedents
of a haunted house. The first owner,
Judge Peter Larcom, had been murdered
beneath its roof back in the
seventies by a maniacal Chinese
cook; one of his daughters had gone
insane; and two other members of
the family had died accidental
deaths. None of them had prospered:
their legend was one of sorrow
and disaster.
</p><p class="calibre13">Some later occupants, who had
purchased the place from the one
surviving son of Peter Larcom, had
left under circumstances of inexplicable
haste after a few months, moving
permanently to San Francisco.
They did not return even for the
briefest visit; and beyond paying
their taxes, they gave no attention
whatever to the place. Everyone had
grown to think of it as a sort of historic
ruin, when the announcement
came that it had been sold to Jean
Averaud, of New Orleans.
</p><p class="calibre13">My first meeting with Averaud
was strangely significant, for it revealed
to me, as years of acquaintance
would not necessarily have
done, the peculiar bias of his mind.
Of course, I had already heard some
odd rumors about him; his personality
was too signal, his advent too
mysterious, to escape the usual fabrication
and mongering of village
tales. I had been told that he was
extravagantly rich, that he was a
recluse of the most eccentric type,
that he had made certain very singular
changes in the inner structure of
the old house; and last, but not least,
that he lived with a beautiful mulatress
who never spoke to anyone
and who was believed to be his mistress
as well as his housekeeper. The
man himself had been described to
me by some as an unusual but harmless
lunatic, and by others as an allround
Mephistopheles.
</p><p class="calibre13">I had seen him several times before
our initial meeting. Pie was a sallow,
saturnine Creole, with the
marks of race in his hollow cheeks
and feverish eyes. I was struck by
his air of intellect, and by the fiery
fixity of his gaze&mdash;the gaze of a man
who is dominated by one idea to the
exclusion of all else. Some medieval
alchemist, who believed himself to be
on the point of attaining his objective
after years of unrelenting research,
might have looked as he did.
</p><p class="calibre13">I was in the Auburn library one
day, when Averaud entered. I had
taken a newspaper from, one of the
tables and was reading the details
of an atrocious crime&mdash;the murder
of a woman and her two infant children
by the husband and father, who
had locked his victims in a clothes-closet,
after saturating their garments
with oil. He had left the woman's
apron-string caught in the shut
door, with the end protruding, and
had set fire to it like a fuse.
</p><p class="calibre13">Averaud passed the table where I
was reading. I looked up, and saw
his glance at the headlines of the
paper I held. A moment later he
returned and sat down beside me,
saying in a low voice:
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">"<b class="calibre11">W</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre14">hat</span> interests me in a
crime of that sort, is the
implication of unhuman forces behind
it. Could any man, on his own
initiative, have conceived and executed
anything so gratuitously fiendish?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I don't know," I replied, somewhat
surprised by the question and
by my interrogator. "There are terrifying
depths in human nature&mdash;more
abhorrent than those of the
jungle."
</p><p class="calibre13">"I agree. But how could such  <span><span id="calibre_link-13" data-page-number="111" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/111" data-page-index="111" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/111"></span></span>impulses, unknown to the most brutal
progenitors of man, have been implanted
in his nature, unless through
some ulterior agency?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"You believe, then, in the existence
of an evil force or entity&mdash;a Satan
or an Ahriman?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I believe in evil&mdash;how can I do
otherwise when I see its manifestations
everywhere? I regard it as an
all-controlling power; but I do not
think that the power is personal, in
the sense of what we know as personality.
A Satan? No. What I
conceive is a sort of dark vibration,
the radiation of a black sun, of a
center of malignant eons&mdash;a radiation
that can penetrate like any other
ray&mdash;and perhaps more deeply. But
probably I don't make my meaning
clear at all."
</p><p class="calibre13">I protested that I understood him;
but, after his burst of communicativeness,
he seemed oddly disinclined
to pursue the conversation.
Evidently he had been prompted to
address me; and no less evidently,
he regretted having spoken with so
much freedom. He arose; but before
leaving, he said:
</p><p class="calibre13">"I am Jean Averaud&mdash;perhaps
you have heard of me. You are
Philip Hastane, the novelist I have
read your books and I admire them.
Come and see me sometime&mdash;we may
have certain tastes and ideas in common."
</p><p class="calibre13">Averaud's personality, the conceptions
he had avowed, and the intense
interest and value which he
so obviously attached to these conceptions,
made a singular impression
on my mind, and I could not forget
him. When, a few days later, I met
him on the street and he repeated
his invitation with a cordialness
that was unfeignedly sincere, I could
do no less than accept I was interested,
though not altogether attracted,
by his bizarre, well-nigh
morbid individuality, and was impelled
by a desire to learn more concerning
him. I sensed a mystery of
no common order&mdash;a mystery with
elements of the abnormal and the
uncanny.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial"><b class="calibre11">T</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre14">he</span> grounds of the old Larcom
place were precisely as I remembered
them, though I had not found
occasion to pass them for some time.
They were a veritable tangle of Cherokee
rose-vines, arbutus, lilac, ivy
and crepe-myrtle, half overshadowed
by the great cypresses and somber
evergreen oaks. There was a wild,
half-sinister charm about them&mdash;the
charm of rampancy and ruin.
Nothing had been done to put the
place in order, and there were no
outward repairs in the house itself,
where the white paint of bygone
years was being slowly replaced by
mosses and lichens that flourished
beneath the eternal umbrage of the
trees. There were signs of decay in
the roof and pillars of the front
porch; and I wondered why the new
owner, who was reputed to be so
rich, had not already made the necessary
restorations.
</p><p class="calibre13">I raised the gargoyle-shaped
knocker and let it fall with a dull,
lugubrious clang. The house remained
silent; and I was about to
knock again, when the door opened
slowly and I saw for the first time
the mulatress of whom so many village
rumors had reached me.
</p><p class="calibre13">The woman was more exotic than
beautiful, with fine, mournful eyes
and bronze-colored features of a
semi-negroid irregularity. Her figure,
though, was truly perfect, with
the curving lines of a lyre and the
supple grace of some feline animal.
When I asked for Jean Averaud, she
merely smiled and made signs for me <span><span id="calibre_link-14" data-page-number="112" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/112" data-page-index="112" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/112"></span></span>to enter. I surmised at once that she
was dumb.
</p><p class="calibre13">Waiting in the gloomy library to
which she conducted me, I could not
refrain from glancing at the volumes
with which the shelves were congested.
They were an ungodly jumble
of tomes that dealt with anthropology,
ancient religions, demonology,
modern science, history, psychoanalysis
and ethics. Interspersed with
these were a few romances and volumes
of poetry. Beausobre's monograph
on ManichÃ¦ism was flanked
with Byron and Poe; and "Les
Fleurs du Mal" jostled a late treatise
on chemistry.
</p><p class="calibre13">Averaud entered, after several
minutes, apologizing profusely for
his delay. He said that he had been
in the midst of certain labors when I
came; but he did not specify the nature
of these labors. He looked even
more hectic and fiery-eyed than when
I had seen him last. He was patently
glad to see me, and eager to talk.
</p><p class="calibre13">"You have been looking at my
books," he observed immediately.
"Though you might not think so at
first glance, on account of their seeming
diversity, I have selected them
all with a single object: the study
of evil in all its aspects, ancient, medieval
and modern. I have traced it
in the religions and demonologies of
all peoples; and, more than this, in
human history itself. I have found
it in the inspiration of poets and romancers
who have dealt with the
darker impulses, emotions and acts
of man. Your novels have interested
me for this reason: you are aware
of the baneful influences which surround
us, which so often sway or
actuate us. I have followed the
working of these agencies even in
chemical reactions, in the growth
and decay of trees, flowers, minerals.
I feel that the processes of physical
decomposition, as well as the similar
mental and moral processes, are due
entirely to them.
</p><p class="calibre13">"In brief, I have postulated a monistic
evil, which is the source of all
death, deterioration, imperfection,
pain, sorrow, madness and disease.
This evil, so feebly counteracted by
the powers of good, allures and fascinates
me above all things. For a
long time past, my life-work has
been to ascertain its true nature, and
trace it to its fountain-head. I am
sure that somewhere in space there
is the center from which all evil
emanates."
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial"><b class="calibre11">H</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre14">e spoke</span> with a wild air of
excitement, of morbid and
semi-maniacal intensity. His obsession
convinced me that he was more
or less unbalanced; but there was
an unholy logic in the development
of his ideas; and I could not but recognize
a certain disordered brilliancy
and range of intellect.
</p><p class="calibre13">Scarcely waiting for me to reply.
he continued his monologue:
</p><p class="calibre13">"I have learned that certain localities
and buildings, certain arrangements
of natural or artificial
objects, are more favorable to the
reception of evil influences than others.
The laws that determine the
degree of receptivity are still obscure
to me; but at least I have verified
the fact itself. As you know, there
are houses or neighborhoods notorious
for a succession of crimes or misfortunes;
and there are also articles,
such as certain jewels, whose possession
is accompanied by disaster.
Such places and things are receivers
of evil<span class="nowrap">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span> I have a theory, however,
that there is always more or
less interference with the direct flow
of the malignant force; and that
pure, absolute evil has never yet
been manifested."
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-15" data-page-number="113" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/113" data-page-index="113" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/113"></span></span>"By the use of some device which
would create a proper field or form
a receiving-station, it should be possible
to evoke this absolute evil. Under
such conditions, I am sure that
the dark vibration would become a
visible and tangible thing, comparable
to light or electricity." He eyed
me with a gaze that was disconcertingly
exigent. Then:
</p><p class="calibre13">"I will confess that I purchased
this old mansion and its grounds
mainly on account of their baleful
history. The place is unusually liable
to the influences of which I have
spoken. I am now at work on an
apparatus by means of which, when
it is perfected, I hope to manifest
in their essential purity the radiations
of malign force."
</p><p class="calibre13">At this moment, the mulatress entered
and passed through the room
on some household errand. I thought
that she gave Averaud a look of maternal
tenderness, watchfulness and
anxiety. He, on his part, seemed
hardly to be aware of her presence,
so engrossed was he in the strange
ideas and the stranger project he
had been expounding. However,
when she had gone, he remarked:
</p><p class="calibre13">"That is Fifine, the one human being
who is really attached to me. She
is mute, but highly intelligent and
affectionate. All my people, an old
Louisiana family, are long departed<span class="nowrap">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>
and my wife is doubly dead to
me." A spasm of obscure pain contracted
his features, and vanished.
He resumed his monologue; and at
no future time did he again refer to
the presumably tragic tale at which
he had hinted: a tale in which, I
sometimes suspect, were hidden the
seeds of the strange moral and
mental perversion which he was to
manifest more and more.
</p><p class="calibre13">I took my leave, after promising
to return for another talk. Of course,
I considered now that Averaud was
a madman: but his madness was of a
most uncommon and picturesque variety.
It seemed significant that he
should have chosen me for a confidant.
All others who met him found
him uncommunicative and taciturn
to an extreme degree. I suppose he
had felt the ordinary human need of
unburdening himself to someone;
and had selected me as the only person
in the neighborhood who was potentially
sympathetic.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial"><b class="calibre11">I</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre14">saw</span> him several times during
the month that followed. He
was indeed a strange psychological
study; and I encouraged him to talk
without reserve&mdash;though such encouragement
was hardly necessary.
There was much that he told me&mdash;a
strange medley of the scientific and
the mystic. I assented tactfully to
all that he said, but ventured to point
out the possible dangers of his evocative
experiments, if they should
prove successful. To this, with the
fervor of an alchemist or a religious
devotee, he replied that it did not
matter&mdash;that he was prepared to accept
any and all consequences.
</p><p class="calibre13">More than once he gave me to understand
that his invention was progressing
favorably. And one day he
said, with abruptness:
</p><p class="calibre13">"I will show you my mechanism,
if you care to see it."
</p><p class="calibre13">I protested my eagerness to view
the invention, and he led me forthwith
into a room to which I had not
been admitted before. The chamber
was large, triangular in form, and
tapestried with curtains of some sullen
black fabric. It had no windows.
Clearly, the internal structure of the
house had been changed in making
it; and the queer village tales, emanating
from carpenters who had
been hired to do the work, were now <span><span id="calibre_link-16" data-page-number="114" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/114" data-page-index="114" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/114"></span></span>explained. Exactly in the center of
the room, there stood on a low tripod
of brass the apparatus of which
Averaud had so often spoken.
</p><p class="calibre13">The contrivance was quite fantastic,
and presented the appearance of
some new, highly complicated musical
instrument. I remember that
there were many wires of varying
thickness, stretched on a series of
concave sounding-boards of some
dark, unlustrous metal; and above
these, there depended from three
horizontal bars a number of square,
circular and triangular gongs. Each
of these appeared to be made of a
different material; some were bright
as gold, or translucent as jade; others
were black and opaque as jet.
A small hammer-like instrument
hung opposite each gong, at the end
of a silver wire.
</p><p class="calibre13">Averaud proceeded to expound the
scientific basis of his mechanism. The
vibrational properties of the gongs,
he said, were designed to neutralize
with their sound-pitch all other cosmic
vibrations than those of evil. He
dwelt at much length on this extravagant
theorem, developing it in a
fashion oddly lucid. He ended his
peroration:
</p><p class="calibre13">"I need one more gong to complete
the instrument; and this I hope to
invent very soon. The triangular
room, draped in black, and without
windows, forms the ideal setting for
my experiment. Apart from this
room, I have not ventured to make
any change in the house or its
grounds, for fear of deranging some
propitious element or collocation of
elements."
</p><p class="calibre13">More than ever, I thought that he
was mad. And, though he had professed
on many occasions to abhor
the evil which he planned to evoke,
I felt an inverted fanaticism in his
attitude. In a less scientific age he
would have been a devil-worshipper,
a partaker in the abominations of
the Black Mass; or would have given
himself to the study and practice of
sorcery. His was a religious soul
that had failed to find good in the
scheme of things; and lacking it, was
impelled to make of evil itself an object
of secret reverence.
</p><p class="calibre13">"I fear that you think me insane,"
he observed in a sudden flash of
clairvoyance. "Would you like to
watch an experiment? Even though
my invention is not completed, I may
be able to convince you that my design
is not altogether the fantasy of
a disordered brain."
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial"><b class="calibre11">I</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre14">consented</span>. He turned on the
lights in the dim room. Then
he went to an angle of the wall and
pressed a hidden spring or switch.
The wires on which the tiny hammers
were strung began to oscillate,
till each of the hammers touched
lightly its companion gong. The
sound they made was dissonant and
disquieting to the last degree&mdash;a diabolic
percussion unlike anything I
have ever heard, and exquisitely
painful to the nerves. I felt as if
a flood of finely broken glass was
pouring into my ears.
</p><p class="calibre13">The swinging of the hammers
grew swifter and heavier; but, to
my surprise, there was no corresponding
increase of loudness in the
sound. On the contrary, the clangor
became slowly muted, till it was no
more than an undertone which
seemed to be coming from an immense
depth or distance&mdash;an undertone
still full of disquietude and torment,
like the sobbing of far-off
winds in hell, or the murmur of demonian
fires on coasts of eternal ice.
Said Averaud at my elbow:
</p><p class="calibre13">"To a certain extent, the combined
notes of the gongs are beyond  <span><span id="calibre_link-17" data-page-number="115" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/115" data-page-index="115" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/115"></span></span>human hearing in their pitch. With the addition of the final gong, even less sound will be audible."
</p><p class="calibre13">While I was trying to digest this difficult idea, I noticed a partial dimming of the light above the tripod and its weird apparatus. A vertical shaft of faint shadow, surrounded by a still fainter penumbra, was forming in the air. The tripod itself, and the wires, gongs and hammers, were now a trifle indistinct, as if seen through some obscuring veil. The central shaft and its penumbra seemed to widen; and looking down at the floor, where the outer adumbration, <span title="[sic] &apos;conforming&apos;" class="calibre15">coforming</span> to the room's outline, crept toward the walls, I saw that Averaud and myself were now within its ghostly triangle.
</p><p class="calibre13">At the same time there surged upon me an intolerable depression, together with a multitude of sensations which I despair of conveying in language. My very sense of space was distorted and deformed, as if some unknown dimension had somehow been mingled with those familiar to us. There was a feeling of dreadful and measureless descent, as if the floor were sinking beneath me into some nether pit; and I seemed to pass beyond the room in a torrent of swirling, hallucinative images, visible but invisible, felt but intangible, and more awful, more accurst than that hurricane of lost-souls beheld by Dante.
</p><p class="calibre13">Down, down, I appeared to go, in the bottomless and phantom hell that was impinging upon reality. Death, decay, malignity, madness, gathered in the air and pressed me down like Satanic incubi in that ecstatic horror of descent. I felt that there were a thousand forms, a thousand faces about me, summoned from the gulfs of perdition. And yet I saw nothing but the white face of Averaud, stamped with a frozen and abominable rapture as he fell beside me.
</p><p class="calibre13">Like a dreamer who forces himself to awaken, he began to move away from me. I seemed to lose sight of him for a moment in the cloud of nameless, immaterial horrors that threatened to take on the further horror of substance. Then I realized that Averaud had turned off the switch, and that the oscillating hammers had ceased to beat on those infernal gongs. The double shaft of shadow faded in mid-air, the burden of terror and despair lifted from my nerves, and I no longer felt the damnable hallucination of nether space and descent.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial">"<b class="calibre11">M</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre14">y God!</span>" I cried. "What was it?"
</p><p class="calibre13">Averaud's look was full of a ghastly, gloating exultation as he turned to me.
</p><p class="calibre13">"You saw and felt it, then?" he queried&mdash;"that vague, imperfect manifestation of the perfect evil which exists somewhere in the cosmos? I shall yet call it forth in its entirety, and know the black, infinite, reverse raptures which attend its epiphany."
</p><p class="calibre13">I recoiled from him with an involuntary shudder. All the hideous things that had swarmed upon me beneath the cacophonous beating of those accurst gongs, drew near again for an instant; and I looked with fearful vertigo into hells of perversity and corruption. I saw an inverted soul, despairing of good, which longed for the baleful ecstasies of perdition. No longer did I think him merely mad: for I knew the thing which he sought and could attain; and I remembered, with a <span><span id="calibre_link-18" data-page-number="116" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/116" data-page-index="116" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/116"></span></span>new significance, that line of Baudelaire's
poem&mdash;"The hell wherein my
heart delights."
</p><p class="calibre13">Averaud was unaware of my revulsion,
in his dark rhapsody. When
I turned to leave, unable to bear
any longer the blasphemous atmosphere
of that room, and the sense of
strange depravity which emanated
from its owner, he pressed me to return
as soon as possible.
</p><p class="calibre13">"I think," he exulted, "that all will
be in readiness before long. I want
you to be present in the hour of my
triumph."
</p><p class="calibre13">I do not know what I said, nor
what excuses I made to get away
from him. I longed to assure myself
that a world of unblasted sunlight
and undefiled air could still exist. I
went out; but a shadow followed me;
and execrable faces leered or moved
from the foliage as I left the cypress-shaded
grounds.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial"><b class="calibre11">F</b></span></span></span><span class="calibre14">or</span> days afterward I was in a
condition verging upon neurotic
disorder. No one could come as
close as I had been to the primal effluence
of evil, and go thence unaffected.
Shadowy noisome cobwebs
draped themselves on all my
thoughts, and presences of unlineamented
fear, of shapeless horror,
crouched in the half-lit corners of
my mind but would never fully declare
themselves. An invisible gulf,
bottomless as Malebolge, seemed to
yawn before me wherever I went.
</p><p class="calibre13">Presently, though, my reason reasserted
itself, and I wondered if
my sensations in the black triangular
room had not been wholly a matter
of suggestion or auto-hypnosis. I
asked myself if it were credible that
a cosmic force of the sort postulated
by Averaud could really exist; or,
granting it existed, could be evoked
by any man through the absurd intermediation
of a musical device.
The nervous terrors of my experience
faded a little in memory; and,
though a disturbing doubt still lingered.
I assured myself that all I
had felt was of purely subjective
origin. Even then, it was with supreme
reluctance, with an inward
shrinking only to be overcome by violent
resolve, that I returned to
visit Averaud once more.
</p><p class="calibre13">For an even longer period than
usual, no one answered my knock.
Then there were hurrying footsteps,
and the door was opened abruptly
by Fifine. I knew immediately that
something was amiss, for her face
wore a look of unnatural dread and
anxiety, and her eyes were wide,
with the whites showing blankly, as
if she had gazed upon horrific
things. She tried to speak, and made
that ghastly inarticulate sound which
the mute is able to make on occasion,
as she plucked my sleeve and
drew me after her along the somber
hall to the triangular room.
</p><p class="calibre13">The door was open; and as I approached
it, I heard a low, dissonant,
snarling murmur, which I recognized
as the sound of the gongs. It was
like the voice of all the souls in a
frozen hell, uttered by lips congealing
slowly toward the ultimate torture
of silence. It sank and sank
till it seemed to be issuing from pits
below the nadir.
</p><p class="calibre13">Fifine shrank back on the threshold,
imploring me with a pitiful
glance to precede her. The lights
were all turned on; and Averaud,
clad in a strange medieval costume,
in a black gown and cap such as
Faustus might have worn, stood near
the percussive mechanism. The hammers
were all beating with a frenzied
rapidity; and the sound became still <span><span id="calibre_link-19" data-page-number="117" data-page-name="Page:Stirring Science Stories, February 1941.djvu/117" data-page-index="117" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Stirring_Science_Stories,_February_1941.djvu/117"></span></span>lower and tenser as I approached,
Averaud did not seem to see me: his
eyes, abnormally dilated, and flaming
with infernal luster like those of one
possessed, were fixed upon something
in mid-air.
</p><p class="calibre13">Again the soul-congealing hideousness,
the sense of eternal falling, of
myriad harpy-like, incumbent horrors,
rushed upon me as I looked and
saw. Vaster and stronger than before,
a double column of triangular
shadow had materialized and was becoming
more and more distinct. It
swelled, it darkened, it enveloped the
gong-apparatus and towered to the
ceiling. The inner column grew solid
and opaque as ebony; and the face
of Averaud, who was standing well
within the broad penumbral shadow,
became dim as if seen through a film
of Stygian water.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
<span class="dropinitial"><span><span class="dropinitial-initial"><b class="calibre11">I</b></span></span></span> <span class="calibre14">must</span> have gone utterly mad for
a while. I remember only a teeming
delirium of things too frightful
to be endured by a sane mind, that
peopled the infinite gulf of hell-born
illusion into which I sank with the
hopeless precipitancy of the damned.
There was a sickness inexpressible, a
vertigo of redeemless descent, a pandemonium
of ghoulish phantoms that
reeled and swayed about the column
of malign omnipotent force which
presided over all. Averaud was only
one more phantom in this delirium,
when with arms outstretched in his
perverse adoration, he stepped toward
the inner column and passed
into it till he was lost to view. And
Fifine was another phantom when
she ran by me to the wall and turned
off the switch that operated those demoniacal
hammers.
</p><p class="calibre13">As one who re-emerges from a
swoon, I saw the fading of the dual
pillar, till the light was no longer
sullied by any tinge of that satanic
radiation. And where it had been,
Averaud still stood beside the baleful
instrument he had designed.
Erect and rigid he stood, in a strange
immobility; and I felt an incredulous
horror, a chill awe, as I went forward
and touched him with a faltering
hand. For that which I saw and
touched was no longer a human being
but an ebon statue, whose face
and brow and fingers were black as
the Faust-like raiment or the sullen
curtains. Charred as by sable fire,
or frozen by black cold, the features
bore the eternal ecstasy and pain of
Lucifer in his ultimate hell of ice.
For an instant, the supreme evil
which Averaud had worshipped so
madly, which he had summoned from
the vaults of incalculable space, had
made him one with itself; and passing,
it had left him petrified into an
image of its own essence. The form
that I touched was harder than marble;
and I knew that it would endure
to ail time as a testimony of the infinite
Medusean power that is death
and corruption and darkness.
</p><p class="calibre13">Fifine had now thrown herself at
the feet of the image and was clasping
its insensible knees. With her
frightful muted moaning in my ears,
I went forth for the last time from
that chamber and from that mansion.
Vainly, through delirious
months and madness-ridden years, I
have tried to shake off the infrangible
obsession of my memories. But
there is a fatal numbness in my
brain, as if it too had been charred
and blackened a little in that moment
of overpowering nearness to
the dark ray that came from pits beyond
the universe. On my mind, as
upon the face of the black statue that
was Jean Averaud, the impress of
awful and forbidden things has been
set like an everlasting seal.
